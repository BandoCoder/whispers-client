## Description

This app allows you to post a secret (Whisper) for the public to view. Anyone can view the whispers logged in or not. To post a whisper, or like a whisper, you must signup and login. The whispers you make are saved to your profile and you can view them later.

There is no delete button, this is on purpose. Once you tell a secret, you cannot untell it.
